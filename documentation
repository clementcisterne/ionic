// Install ionic

     - First, install Node.js 4 (Node 5 does not work at the moment!).
     - Then, install the latest Cordova and Ionic command-line tools.
     - Follow the Android and iOS platform guides to install required platform dependencies.

     Note: iOS development requires Mac OS X. iOS simulator through the Ionic CLI requires the ios-sim
     npm package, which can be installed with the command sudo npm -g install ios-sim.

    $ npm install -g cordova ionic

    Windows users: We strongly recommend Visual Studio Community for development which comes with everything you need (including templates!)


// Start a project

     Create an Ionic project using one of our ready-made app templates, or a blank one to start fresh.

    $ ionic start myApp tabs
    $ ionic start myApp blank
    $ ionic start myApp tabs
    $ ionic start myApp sidemenu


// Run it

    Use the Ionic tool to build, test, and run your apps (or use Cordova directly). Make sure to substitute ios with android to build for Android.

    Then, try Ionic View to share your apps with testers and clients, or to easily test on new devices.

    $ cd myApp
    $ ionic platform add ios
    $ ionic build ios
    $ ionic emulate ios
